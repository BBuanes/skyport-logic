SYNOPSIS
    This file describes the protocol used by the AIs to communicate with the
    Server.

TRANSPORT
    The transport protocol used is line-based TCP.
    When reading from the socket, make sure that you don't limit the length of
    your lines, as some packets may end up rather large.

CODEC & FORMAT
    Codec used for all transmissions is a line-based JSON format. This has been
    chosen to avoid the trouble of making a separate format and requiring the
    AIs to implement a parser for it. JSON is a simple, text-based format with
    a syntax inspired by javascript.
    Read about JSON here: http://json.org/
    At the bottom of the page, you will find a list of existing JSON parsers for
    various languages. This protocol does not use any special JSON features, does
    not require you to have capabilities like partial JSON parsing, and does not
    require you to deal with special characters/unicode. However, chosing a JSON
    parser that is reasonably fast may give you an advantage.
    Make sure that when you read from the TCP socket
