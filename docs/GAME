SYNOPSIS
    This file describes the game rules as implemented by the server.
    

MAP
    The map is a hexagonal grid of tiles. See PROTOCOL/MAP-OBJECT for an exact description
    of the map format used. In short, the tiles have a normal coordinate system
    imposed on them:



     J-coordinate                      K-coordinate
      \                               /
       \                             /
        \                _____      /
         \         <0>  /     \  <0>
          \            /       \
           \     ,----(   0,0   )----.
            <1> /      \       /      \ <1>
         _____ /  1,0   \_____/  0,1   \_____
    <2> /      \        /     \        /     \  <2>
       /        \      /       \      /       \
      (   2,0    )----(   1,1   )----(   0,2   )
       \        /      \       /      \       /
        \_____ /  2,1   \_____/  1,2   \_____/
               \        /     \        /
                \      /       \      /
                 `----(   2,2   )----'
                       \       /
                        \_____/

    Positions are always written as [J, K], i.e. the J-coordinate comes first, the K-coordinate second.
