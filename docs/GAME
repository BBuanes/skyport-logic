SYNOPSIS
    This file describes the game rules as implemented by the server.
    

MAP
    The map is a hexagonal grid of tiles. See PROTOCOL/MAP-OBJECT for an exact description
    of the map format used. In short, the tiles have a normal coordinate system
    imposed on them:



     J-coordinate                      K-coordinate
      \                               /
       \                             /
        \                _____      /
         \         <0>  /     \  <0>
          \            /       \
           \     ,----(   0,0   )----.
            <1> /      \       /      \ <1>
         _____ /  1,0   \_____/  0,1   \_____
    <2> /      \        /     \        /     \  <2>
       /        \      /       \      /       \
      (   2,0    )----(   1,1   )----(   0,2   )
       \        /      \       /      \       /
        \_____ /  2,1   \_____/  1,2   \_____/
               \        /     \        /
                \      /       \      /
                 `----(   2,2   )----'
                       \       /
                        \_____/

    Positions are always written as [J, K], i.e. the J-coordinate comes first,
    the K-coordinate second. For instance, you may send the server a message
    such as "go to [1,0]" and then "fire mortar [2,2]". The server would then
    first move you to the tile [1, 0], and then perform your mortar shot,
    assuming it is in range.
    There are seven different types of tiles, as described in the next section.

TILES
    ACCESSIBLE TILES (These tiles can be moved onto)
        GRASS     - normal grassland. No effect. May come in various forms and colors, but
    	            robots don't care about aesthetics.
    INACCESSIBLE TILES (These tiles cannot be moved onto, but the server may place you on them.)
    	VOID      - No tile at all.	
        SPAWN     - protected spawn area. Once you move away from it, you can't re-enter.
        ROCK      - A rock is blocking the way.
	EXPLODIUM - Cannot be moved onto, but if you are in its immediate proximity,
	            you will continuously gain explodium for each round.
        RUBIDIUM  - Cannot be moved onto, but if you are in its immediate proximity,
		    you will continuously gain rubidium for each round.
        COGS      - Cannot be moved onto, but if you are in its immediate proximity,
                    you will continuously gain cogs for each round.

TURNS
    Each round, each player gets three turns. In a turn, he may move to any
    adjacent tile, covering a maximal distance of three tiles per turn. A
    player may chose to use an action for something else, such as firing a
    weapon or simply waiting. Firing a weapon immediately ends the turn, but
    any left-over actions give your attack an extra damage bonus.
    Waiting incurrs a small point/health penality, so that inactive AIs will
    get kicked out after a while.
    After a players turn is over, the gamestate is sent to all clients, and
    the next player may make his turn.
		    
WEAPONS
    There are three basic weapons, the laser, the mortar and the battle droid.
    Each weapon may be upgraded three times, to increase its range and damage,
    see the next sections.

MORTAR
    The mortar is the easiest to use; it simply has a radius/range, and it
    hit any tile inside that range. An alternative interpretation (resulting
    in the same tiles) is to say "the mortar can move a fixed number of steps
    in any direction. Any tile it can reach in that number of steps, is in
    range". The mortar is unaffected by gaps and rocks, but shooting at them
    has no effect. The mortar carries a small explosive load, and hence has
    a very weak AoE bonus damage at a radius of one tile.
    Range at level 1: 2 tiles
    Range at level 2: 3 tiles
    Range at level 3: 4 tiles
    See range-mortar.png for a visualization.
    
LASER
    The laser has the longest range, and shoots straight. That means there
    are tiles it cannot reach, without moving into a different position first.
    The laser can shoot over gaps, but not through rocks.
    Range at level 1: 5 tiles
    Range at level 2: 6 tiles
    Range at level 3: 7 tiles
    See range-laser.png for a visualization.
    
DROID
    The droid requires the player to send a list of directional steps.
    It has a fixed number of steps it can walk, after which it will explode,
    whether it has reached its target or not. The droid cannot walk over gaps
    or rocks, so it has to navigate around them. The droid carries a big
    explosive payload and induces a massive AoE damage bonus, at a radius of
    one tile.
    Range at level 1: 3 steps
    Range at level 2: 4 steps
    Range at level 3: 5 steps
