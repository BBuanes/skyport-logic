SYNOPSIS
    This file describes the game rules as implemented by the server.
    

MAP
    The map is a hexagonal grid of tiles. See PROTOCOL/MAP-OBJECT for an exact description
    of the map format used. In short, the tiles have a normal coordinate system
    imposed on them:



     J-coordinate                      K-coordinate
      \                               /
       \                             /
        \                _____      /
         \         <0>  /     \  <0>
          \            /       \
           \     ,----(   0,0   )----.
            <1> /      \       /      \ <1>
         _____ /  1,0   \_____/  0,1   \_____
    <2> /      \        /     \        /     \  <2>
       /        \      /       \      /       \
      (   2,0    )----(   1,1   )----(   0,2   )
       \        /      \       /      \       /
        \_____ /  2,1   \_____/  1,2   \_____/
               \        /     \        /
                \      /       \      /
                 `----(   2,2   )----'
                       \       /
                        \_____/

    Positions are always written as [J, K], i.e. the J-coordinate comes first,
    the K-coordinate second. For instance, you may send the server a message
    such as "go to [1,0]" and then "fire mortar [2,2]". The server would then
    first move you to the tile [1, 0], and then perform your mortar shot,
    assuming it is in range.
    There are seven different types of tiles, as described in the next section.

TILES
    ACCESSIBLE TILES (These tiles can be moved onto)
        GRASS     - normal grassland. No effect. May come in various forms and colors, but
    	            robots don't care about aesthetics.
    INACCESSIBLE TILES (These tiles cannot be moved onto, but the server may place you on them.)
    	VOID      - No tile at all.	
        SPAWN     - protected spawn area. Once you move away from it, you can't re-enter.
        ROCK      - A rock is blocking the way.
	EXPLODIUM - Cannot be moved onto, but if you are in its immediate proximity,
	            you will continuously gain explodium for each round.
        RUBIDIUM  - Cannot be moved onto, but if you are in its immediate proximity,
		    you will continuously gain rubidium for each round.
        COGS      - Cannot be moved onto, but if you are in its immediate proximity,
                    you will continuously gain cogs for each round.

WEAPONS
    There are three basic weapons, the laser, the mortar and the battle droid.
    Each weapon may be upgraded three times, to increase its range and damage,
