point allocation notes:
-count damage only of other players
	-Maybe easier to ignore all damage alltogether when self-inflicted, but that wouldn't be as fun would it? =P -Emil
shooting:
-moving on and off of spawn tiles?
-damaging on spawn tiles?
-should shots move through spawn tiles?
    -I think they should, as long as all damage inflicted on any unsuspecting AI standing on it is reflected -Emil
    -I think instead of making spawn tiles impervious to damage, we should just give each user one round
     of immortality...
- death & damage notifications into protocol?

- check tiles register & unregister players correctly for all situations as they move onto/off the tile.
f.ex. respawning
- bonus dmg
- mortar shots outside map
upgrading
- mortar shots into void cause AoE damage?
