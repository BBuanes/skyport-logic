point allocation notes:
-count damage only of other players
	-Maybe easier to ignore all damage alltogether when self-inflicted, but that wouldn't be as fun would it? =P -Emil
shooting:
-moving on and off of spawn tiles?
-damaging on spawn tiles?
-should shots move through spawn tiles?
	-I think they should, as long as all damage inflicted on any unsuspecting AI standing on it is reflected -Emil
