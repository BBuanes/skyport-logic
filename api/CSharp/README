Created with VS2010 as console application.
To run the included SimpleWalker AI, right-click the
"SimpleWalker" project in the VS solution explorer,
then click "Set as StartUp Project". After that, the
play button should compile & start the test-AI & API
automatically.

The API still lacks a little in the error handling
department, but all functionality should be working.
